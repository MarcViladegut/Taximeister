# The taxi app with Android: Taximeister


## Introduction

The repository contains a project of the subject network platforms of the University of Lleida. This repository contains a project that refers to a taxis application and is focused on small cities, such as Lleida. The application will be developed in the IDE Android Studio and will be the project chosen for the subject of network platforms in the course 2018/2019.

The application is 100% adapted for the LG H850 mobile phone and its corresponding screen resolution. It is not fully adapted for other sizes or ressolutions of screens that are not equal to or similar to that of the mobile phone used in the project.


## The app

The final function of the application is to reserve or request a taxi to be able to move at a specific time. The application will have the following characteristics:

* **Shared login**. Taxi drivers and clients will share the same application, but the interface once it is logged will be different from each other.

* **Customize your app**. You can change a map style, currency and much visual features of the map.

* **Customize your reservation**. It is possible to book now, as in a month. The application offers a lot of flexibility when making reservations both in locations and dates.

* **Rate taxi drivers**. It is possible to score taxi drivers to show other users of the services and opinions regarding each driver who is in the application.

* **Payments via Paypal**. The application contains third-party services that allow the use of payments through a secure environment such as PayPal. The application is used by means of tests, at no time does any transaction take place.

The delivery of this first application prototype is carried out before April 1 on the platform of the Virtual Campus of the University of Lleida, along with the file of the type APK generated.
